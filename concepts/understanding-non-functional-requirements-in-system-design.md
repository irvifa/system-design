# Understanding Non-Functional Requirements in System Design

When designing complex systems, developers often focus primarily on functional requirements—what the system does. However, non-functional requirements are equally crucial in creating robust, efficient, and reliable software architectures. Let's dive deep into the world of non-functional requirements and why they matter.

### What Are Non-Functional Requirements?

Unlike functional requirements that describe a system's inputs and outputs, non-functional requirements encompass the broader characteristics that determine a system's overall quality and performance. These requirements include:

* **Scalability**: How easily the system can adjust to increased load
* **Availability**: The percentage of time the system remains operational
* **Performance**: Response times and system throughput
* **Fault-tolerance**: The ability to continue functioning during component failures
* **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access
* **Privacy**: Controlling access to personally identifiable information
* **Consistency**: Ensuring data matches across all system nodes
* **Cost-effectiveness**: Balancing system capabilities with resource constraints

### The Importance of Clarification

One critical insight is that customers rarely explicitly outline all non-functional requirements. They often assume these aspects will be naturally incorporated into the system design. This assumption can lead to:

* Incomplete requirement specifications
* Misunderstandings about system capabilities
* Potential over-engineering or under-engineering of solutions

### Key Non-Functional Requirement Considerations

#### Scalability: Handling Growth Strategically

Scalability is about efficiently expanding your system's capacity. There are two primary approaches:

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading a single host's hardware
   * Pros: Conceptually simple
   * Cons:
     * Expensive at higher levels
     * Technological limitations
     * Potential downtime during upgrades
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributing load across multiple hosts
   * Preferred method in modern system design
   * Allows for more flexible and cost-effective growth
   * Essential for handling increased user loads and data volumes

#### Availability: Measuring System Uptime

Availability is typically measured in "nines":

* 99.9% (three nines): \~8.77 hours of downtime per year
* 99.99% (four nines): \~52.6 minutes of downtime per year
* 99.999% (five nines): \~5.26 minutes of downtime per year

#### Fault Tolerance: Ensuring Resilience

Key strategies include:

* Replication: Maintaining multiple redundant instances
* Self-healing mechanisms
* Graceful degradation when components fail

### Fault Tolerance: Advanced Strategies

Beyond basic redundancy, system designers have several sophisticated techniques to enhance fault tolerance:

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

A circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to a service that appears to be failing. When a service experiences repeated errors, the circuit breaker:

* Stops making requests to the problematic service
* Periodically tests if the service has recovered
* Prevents overwhelming already stressed systems

#### Exponential Backoff and Retry

This strategy involves:

* Incrementally increasing wait times between retry attempts
* Adding "jitter" (small random variations) to prevent synchronized retry attempts
* Gradually backing off to give systems time to recover

#### Caching and Graceful Degradation

When external services fail, intelligent systems can:

* Cache previous successful responses
* Provide default or placeholder data
* Maintain partial functionality instead of complete failure

#### Checkpointing

Critical for long-running data processing jobs, checkpointing:

* Saves progress at regular intervals
* Allows systems to resume from the last successful state after a failure
* Particularly useful in streaming and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines

#### Dead Letter Queues

For handling failed write requests, dead letter queues:

* Store requests that couldn't be processed
* Allow for later retry or manual intervention
* Prevent permanent data loss

#### Bulkhead Pattern

Inspired by maritime ship design, the bulkhead pattern:

* Isolates system components
* Prevents failures in one area from cascading
* Allows partial system functionality during localized issues

### Fallback Pattern: Resilience Through Alternative Strategies

The fallback pattern is a sophisticated approach to maintaining system reliability when primary services fail. Key characteristics include:

* **Detecting Service Problems**: Identifying when a primary service is unavailable
* **Alternative Execution Paths**: Providing backup methods to retrieve or process information
* **Flexible Response Handling**: Offering cached or alternative data instead of complete failure

Practical Examples:

* Caching previous responses for use during outages
* Redirecting to alternative third-party services
* Providing historical or placeholder data

**Important Consideration**: Always evaluate the reliability of your fallback mechanism, as the fallback itself could potentially fail.

### Performance and Latency: Optimizing System Responsiveness

Performance is more than just speed—it's about how quickly and efficiently a system responds to user requests. Key insights include:

#### Understanding Latency

* **Definition**: Total time from request initiation to response completion
* Includes network travel time, processing time, and response transmission
* Typical consumer app latency: tens of milliseconds to several seconds
* Specialized systems (like high-frequency trading) may require millisecond-level responses

#### Strategies for Reducing Latency

Geographical Optimization

* Deploy services close to user clusters
* Use multiple data centers to minimize network distance

Technical Approaches

* Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
* Utilize caching mechanisms
* Use efficient communication protocols (RPC over REST)
* Employ batch and streaming techniques

#### Latency vs. Throughput

* **Latency**: Time to complete a single request
* **Throughput**: Number of requests processed in a given time
* Lower latency often correlates with higher throughput

#### Design Considerations

* Evaluate data characteristics and processing requirements
* Consider asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks
* Aggregate data during write operations to optimize read performance

### Consistency: Balancing Data Integrity and Performance

Consistency in distributed systems involves complex trade-offs:

#### Types of Consistency

1. **ACID Consistency**
   * Focuses on data relationship integrity
   * Ensures referential and uniqueness constraints
2. **CAP Theorem Consistency (Linearizability)**
   * All nodes contain identical data at a given moment
   * Synchronous data changes across system

#### Consistency Strategies

* **Linearizability**: Strict, real-time data synchronization
* **Eventual Consistency**: Temporary data divergence with eventual alignment
* **Trade-offs**: Balancing consistency with availability, scalability, and latency

#### Database Approaches

Some databases prioritize:

* **Linearizability**: MongoDB, HBase, Redis
* **Availability**: Cassandra, CouchDB, Dynamo

### Tradeoffs and Considerations

Non-functional requirements are rarely achieved in isolation. They often involve strategic tradeoffs:

* Improving availability might impact consistency
* Enhancing security could increase latency
* Increasing fault-tolerance might raise implementation complexity

### Complexity and Maintainability

Minimizing complexity is crucial in system design. The first step is to clarify both functional and non-functional requirements to avoid designing for unnecessary features.

#### Common Generalizable Services

To reduce complexity and improve maintainability, consider implementing:

* Load balancer service
* Rate limiting
* Authentication and authorization
* Logging, monitoring, and alerting
* TLS termination
* Caching
* DevOps and CI/CD (if applicable)

#### Managing System Complexity

* Separate components into independent systems where possible
* Consider trade-offs between complexity and system requirements
* Use techniques like ETL pipelines to delay non-real-time data processing
* Minimize message sizes using RPC serialization frameworks (Avro, Thrift, protobuf)

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment offers significant advantages:

* Easy deployments and rollbacks
* Fast feedback cycles
* Improved system maintainability
* Quick recovery from buggy builds

#### Deployment Techniques

* Blue/green deployments (zero downtime)
* Using static code analysis tools like SonarQube
* Incremental feature rollouts
* Rapid software development lifecycle

### Cost Considerations in System Design

In system design, cost is a critical factor that often requires strategic trade-offs between different non-functional requirements:

#### Strategic Cost Trade-offs

1. **Scaling Strategies**
   * Higher cost for lower complexity through vertical scaling
   * Lower costs by choosing horizontal scaling with more efficient resource utilization
2. **Availability vs. Cost**
   * Reduce system redundancy to decrease expenses
   * Adjust replication factors in databases
   * Balance between system reliability and budget constraints
3. **Latency Trade-offs**
   * Choose data center locations with lower operational costs
   * Accept slightly increased latency for significant cost savings

#### Monitoring and Maintenance Costs

* Implement targeted monitoring aligned with system criticality
* Avoid over-alerting to reduce unnecessary operational overhead
* Create alert strategies that match the urgency of potential issues

#### Dependency Management

* Anticipate future update requirements
* Identify potential risks with third-party dependencies
* Design systems with modularity to facilitate easier component replacement

#### System Decommissioning Considerations

* Plan for potential system retirement
* Develop data extraction strategies
* Consider user data migration and preservation

### Security in System Design

#### Key Security Considerations

1. **Encryption Strategies**
   * TLS termination vs. encryption in transit
   * Determine appropriate encryption for data at rest
   * Implement robust access control mechanisms
2. **Authentication Protocols**
   * Understand OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
   * Implement rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks

### Privacy and Data Protection

#### Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

* Comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA
* Implement strong access control mechanisms
* Use hashing algorithms to protect individual privacy
* Develop comprehensive data retention and deletion policies

#### Internal vs. External Service Security

* Adopt a default security-first approach
* Implement role-based access controls
